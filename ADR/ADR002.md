# Use of Multiple Proprietary Medical Devices for Direct Data Transmission to Gateway

## Context
The current hospital environment relies on larger, centralized medical devices for patient data collection and transmission. 
However, this approach has limitations in terms of mobility, scalability, and adaptability to varying patient needs. 
The emergence of smaller, portable medical devices with built-in data transmission capabilities has opened up the 
possibility of decentralizing data collection and transmission processes. 
This shift could potentially improve patient care, increase efficiency, and enable more dynamic patient monitoring.

## Status
Proposed

## Decision
It is proposed to adopt the use of multiple smaller medical devices equipped with data transmission capabilities to send data directly to the Gateway.
These devices would be distributed across various departments and units, enabling more frequent and targeted data collection. 
The Gateway would serve as a centralized hub for consolidating the received data, and sending it forward.

## Consequences

Pros:
  * Improved Mobility: Smaller devices allow for easier and more frequent patient monitoring, which can lead to better patient outcomes.
  *  Scalability: The decentralized approach allows for easy expansion and adaptation to different patient needs and care settings.
  *  Efficiency: Direct data transmission reduces the need for manual data entry, decreasing the risk of errors and freeing up healthcare professionals' time.
  *  Enhanced Data Security: The Gateway can be equipped with robust security measures to protect patient data.
  
Cons:
   * Initial Investment: Acquiring and implementing multiple smaller devices and a Gateway would require an upfront investment.
   * Integration Challenges: Ensuring seamless integration with existing hospital systems and protocols may require additional effort and resources.
   * Staff Training: Healthcare professionals may need training to use the new devices and workflows effectively.
