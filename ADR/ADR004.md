## Decision
The decision to use WLAN for Web App data requests to the on-premise server "MonitorMe" is made to achieve the following benefits:
    * Flexibility and Mobility: WLAN allows healthcare professionals to access patient data from anywhere within the hospital premises, facilitating mobility and flexibility in patient care.
    * Real-Time Data Access: Wireless access enables real-time data retrieval, enabling healthcare professionals to make timely and informed decisions.
    * Scalability: WLAN can easily accommodate a growing number of devices and users, supporting the hospital's evolving needs.
    * Cost-Efficiency: WLAN infrastructure can be more cost-effective than wired alternatives, particularly in large hospital environments.

## Consequences

Pros:
   * Improved Efficiency: WLAN enables healthcare professionals to access patient data quickly and conveniently, improving overall workflow efficiency.
   * Enhanced Patient Care: Real-time data access allows for more timely interventions and adjustments to treatment plans, leading to better patient outcomes.
   * Reduced Infrastructure Complexity: WLAN eliminates the need for complex cabling and reduces installation and maintenance costs.
   * Increased Flexibility: WLAN allows for more flexible device placement and usage within the hospital, supporting various care scenarios.
  
Cons:
   * Security Considerations: WLAN networks require robust security measures to protect patient data from unauthorized access or interception.
   * Network Reliability: WLAN networks can be susceptible to interference and signal degradation, impacting data transmission reliability.
   * Infrastructure Investment: Setting up and maintaining a WLAN infrastructure requires initial investment in access points, switches, and security measures.
