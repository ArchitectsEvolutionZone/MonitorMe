# Device Gateway Wired Communication with On-Premise Server "MonitorMe"

## Context
The on-premise server "MonitorMe" serves as a vital component in the hospital's data management infrastructure. 
It's responsible for receiving, storing, and updating patient medical data from various sources, including the devices mentioned earlier. 
Given the critical nature of this data and the need for rapid access, 
ensuring a robust and reliable communication method between the devices and the server is paramount.

## Status
Proposed

## Decision
The decision is to implement a wired communication protocol between the Device Gateway and the on-premise server "MonitorMe."
Reasons for this choice are:
    * Reliability: Wired connections generally offer better reliability and consistency compared to wireless alternatives, reducing the risk of data loss or transmission errors.
    * Security: Wired communication is inherently more secure as it's not subject to the same vulnerabilities as wireless transmissions, such as interception or interference.
    * Bandwidth: Wired connections typically offer higher bandwidth, allowing for faster data transfer, essential for real-time patient monitoring.
    * Stability: Wired connections are less prone to environmental factors that can affect wireless signals, ensuring a stable and consistent connection.

## Consequences

Pros:
    * Enhanced Data Integrity: Wired communication minimizes the risk of data corruption or loss, ensuring that the latest patient information is accurately transmitted and stored.
    * Increased Security: The use of a wired connection reduces the risk of unauthorized access or interception of sensitive patient data.
    * Fast and Reliable Access: The on-premise server can quickly access the latest patient status information stored in memory cache, enabling faster decision-making and response times.
  
Cons:
   *  Infrastructure Cost: Implementing a wired communication infrastructure may require additional investment in cabling, switches, and related equipment.
   *  Installation and Maintenance: The installation and maintenance of wired connections can be more complex than wireless alternatives, requiring skilled technicians and regular upkeep.
