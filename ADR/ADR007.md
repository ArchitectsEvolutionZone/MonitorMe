# Adopting RabbitMQ as the Messaging Broker for DeviceGateway

## Context
While using DeviceGateway, a physical device with embedded software designed to 
facilitate communication between various components in our ecosystem, 
we require a messaging broker to efficiently route and manage messages exchanged between components, 
supporting both wired and wireless (WLAN) communication channels. 
RabbitMQ, a robust and flexible message broker, is being considered for this role.

## Decision: 
The decision is to implement a message broker physical component, which would facilitate data transmission between various types of devices and
consumers, over wired and wireless communication.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences

   * Efficient Message Routing: RabbitMQ's support for multiple messaging protocols and message persistence will allow DeviceGateway to efficiently route and manage messages, ensuring reliable and timely delivery between components.
   * Flexibility: RabbitMQ's support for various messaging patterns, such as publish-subscribe and point-to-point, will provide flexibility in designing communication flows between components.
   * Scalability: RabbitMQ's ability to handle large volumes of messages and maintain high availability will support scalability as our ecosystem grows.
   * Security: RabbitMQ provides robust security features, such as access control lists (ACLs), SSL/TLS encryption, and user authentication, ensuring secure communication between components.
   * Monitoring and Management: RabbitMQ offers extensive monitoring and management capabilities, allowing us to track message delivery, monitor queues, and troubleshoot issues, ensuring the overall health and performance of our communication infrastructure.
