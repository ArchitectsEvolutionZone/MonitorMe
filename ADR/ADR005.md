# Mobile App use for Nurses to Receive Alerts and Notifications from On-Premise Server "MonitorMe" via WLAN

## Context
Nurses play a critical role in patient care, often requiring real-time access to patient data and alerts. 
The decision to implement a mobile app that allows nurses to receive alerts from the on-premise server "MonitorMe" is driven by the need to
improve response times and provide greater flexibility in patient monitoring.

## Decision
The decision to use a mobile app for nurses to receive alerts from the on-premise server "MonitorMe" via WLAN is made to achieve the following benefits:
    * Real-Time Alerts: The mobile app provides nurses with immediate access to patient alerts, ensuring timely response to critical events.
    * Enhanced Communication: The mobile app facilitates seamless communication between the on-premise server "MonitorMe" and nurses, improving coordination and efficiency.
    * Improved Response Times: Nurses can quickly receive and respond to alerts, leading to faster interventions and improved patient outcomes.
    * Greater Flexibility: Nurses can access alerts from anywhere within the hospital premises, enhancing flexibility and mobility.

## Consequences

Pros:
    * Enhanced Patient Safety: Real-time alerts enable nurses to quickly respond to critical patient events, improving overall patient safety.
    * Streamlined Workflow: The mobile app streamlines communication and alerts, reducing the time needed to access and respond to critical information.
    * Increased Efficiency: Real-time alerts and communication can lead to more efficient patient monitoring and care delivery.
    * Improved Nurse Satisfaction: Providing nurses with tools that facilitate their work and improve efficiency can lead to increased job satisfaction.
  
Cons:
   * Security Considerations: The mobile app must comply with strict security standards to protect patient data and maintain privacy.
   * Network Reliability: WLAN networks can be susceptible to interference and signal degradation, impacting the reliability of alert delivery.
   * Training and Adoption: Nurses may require training to effectively use the mobile app and its features, and some may be resistant to adopting new technology.
