# Using Wired Communication between On-Premise Server and CMS

## Context
Considering that CMS requires fast and reliable data from the On-Premise Server,
which stores and processes data, a type of connection would be required.

## Decision: 
We will use Ethernet (wired communication) for the data transmission between the on-premise server and the CMS.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences

   * Reliability: Wired communication, especially Ethernet, is known for its reliability. It is less prone to interference and signal loss compared to wireless communication methods.

   * Stability: Ethernet provides a stable and consistent connection, ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and with minimal latency. This stability is crucial for real-time data monitoring and analytics.

   * Bandwidth: Ethernet offers higher bandwidth compared to wireless technologies. This allows for faster data transfer rates, which is beneficial when transmitting large amounts of data to the CMS.

   * Security: Wired communication is generally considered more secure than wireless communication. The data transmitted over Ethernet is less susceptible to interception or hacking attempts.

   * Cost: Implementing wired communication may involve initial costs for setting up the infrastructure, such as Ethernet cables, switches, and routers. However, the long-term benefits in terms of reliability, stability, and security can justify this initial investment.

   * Scalability: Ethernet-based communication infrastructure is scalable, allowing for future expansion or upgrades without significant changes to the existing setup.
