# Architecture Style

## Decision Summary:
In the requirements analysis phase, the team identified Performance, Responsiveness, and Fault Tolerance as pivotal architectural characteristics for the MonitorMe system. Following an assessment using the Architecture Styles Worksheet, the team concluded that adopting an event-driven architecture would be the most suitable solution.

## Consequences:

### Positive:

Real-time Responsiveness: Event-driven architectures excel at delivering real-time updates, aligning with the system's goal of monitoring vital signs promptly and providing instantaneous notifications to medical professionals.

Fault Tolerance Enhancement: The event-driven approach enhances fault tolerance by enabling the system to gracefully handle faults or disruptions, ensuring uninterrupted monitoring and alerting capabilities.

The decision to embrace an event-driven architecture for the MonitorMe system is substantiated by its positive impact on adaptability, integration, real-time responsiveness, scalability, and fault tolerance. Acknowledging potential challenges, the team is poised to capitalize on the benefits while proactively addressing complexities, learning curve factors, and risks associated with data consistency and routing logic.

Adaptability Benefit: Leveraging an event-driven architecture provides adaptability, empowering the MonitorMe system to seamlessly integrate new features and integrations without causing major disruptions.

### Negative:

Complexity Challenge: While event-driven architectures offer flexibility, they may introduce complexity, especially in managing event flows and ensuring data consistency across the distributed system.

Operational Practices Challenge: Operating a distributed event-driven system requires the implementation of robust operational practices and continuous monitoring to uphold system health.
Learning Curve Challenge: Event-driven development may pose a learning curve for the development team, requiring the acquisition of new skills and practices.

### Risks:

Data Consistency Risk: Ensuring data consistency across distributed components presents a challenge, with the potential risk of data discrepancies if not handled meticulously.

Routing Logic Risk: The intricacies of complex event routing logic may pose difficulties in management and debugging, potentially leading to errors or delays in the system.
