![Capabilities diagram](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/resources/capabilities%20overview%203.png)

By analyzing the [provided requirements](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/1.Requirements/ClientInitialRequirements.md), the MonitorMe app is designed to allow hospital staff esily setup a new patient and start monitoring his vital signs, in order to provide the best care. 

An initial step is for the Hospital Administrator to register medical professionals in the system. Once this is done, medical professionals can then login, either from the Web or the Mobile app. 

Before putting the system in use, the vital sign monitoring devices will be registered and the Consolidated Monitoring Screens will be configured based on the rooms of the hospital. 

Once this setup is made, medical professionals are ready to register and monitor patients through the MonitorMe system.
