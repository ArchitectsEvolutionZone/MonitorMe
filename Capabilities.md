![Capabilities diagram](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/resources/capabilities%20overview%203.png)

The MonitorMe app is designed to allow hospital staff esyly setup a new patient in the hospital and start monitoring his vital signs, in order to provide the best care. 

An initial step is for the Hospital Administrator to register medical professionals in the system. Once this is done, medical professionals can then login into the system, either from the Web or the Mobile app. 

Before putting the system in use, the vital sign monitoring devices will be registered and the Consolidated Monitoring Screens will be configured based on the rooms of the hospital. 

Once this setup is made, medical professionals are ready to register and monitor patients through the MonitorMe system.


Get to know how each role will interact with the MonitorMe system by following the user journeys of a [Hospital Administrator](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/UserJourneysFolder/HospitalAdmin.md), [Medical Professionals](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/UserJourneysFolder/MedicalProfessional.md) and [hospital patients](https://github.com/ArchitectsEvolutionZone/MonitorMe/blob/main/UserJourneysFolder/Patient.md) (who will interact through with the system, through the Medical Professionals).
