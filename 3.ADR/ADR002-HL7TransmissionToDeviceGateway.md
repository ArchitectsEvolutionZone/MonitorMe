# Use of Multiple Medical Devices for Direct Data Transmission to Gateway, using HL7

## Context
The current hospital environment relies on larger, centralized medical devices for patient data collection and transmission. 
However, this approach has limitations in terms of mobility, scalability, and adaptability to varying patient needs. 
The emergence of smaller, portable medical devices with built-in data transmission capabilities has opened up the 
possibility of decentralizing data collection and transmission processes. 
This shift could potentially improve patient care, increase efficiency, and enable more dynamic patient monitoring.

## Status
Proposed

## Decision
It is proposed to adopt the use of multiple smaller HL7 standard medical devices to send data directly to the Gateway,
in order to achieve the following benefits:
   * Interoperability: The HL7 standard ensures that medical devices from different vendors can communicate and share data seamlessly, reducing vendor lock-in and allowing for greater flexibility in device     selection. 
   * Data Standardization: HL7 provides a standardized format for data exchange, making it easier to integrate new devices and systems into the hospital's existing infrastructure.
   * Streamlined Data Management: HL7 facilitates the exchange of structured, standardized data, reducing the need for manual data entry and improving data quality.
   * Regulatory Compliance: HL7 is widely recognized and adopted in the healthcare industry, helping hospitals to comply with regulatory requirements for data exchange and interoperability.
    
## Consequences
In order to be in regulatory compliance, improve data quality and enhance interoperability, using an established protocol like HL7 
to facilitate data transmission between device and gateway would be ideal, would lead to lower costs in the long run 
due to lower implementation costs for standard protocols, which also permits a wider range of sensors and medical devices to be integrated.
This same protocol would be used going forward to any and all transfer of medical data.

## Options
  * Centralized Data Aggregation: Instead of directly transmitting data from multiple medical devices to the Gateway, we have considered implementing a centralized data aggregation layer or "server" within the hospital network. This layer could receive data from various medical devices using HL7 standards and then transmit aggregated data to the Device Gateway, no longer needing direct device-to-Gateway communication and avoiding the drawbacks that come with that.

  * Use of Proprietary Protocols: We could also explore using proprietary communication protocols specific to certain medical device manufacturers. While HL7 provides interoperability and standardization benefits, some medical devices may offer proprietary protocols that provide additional features or optimizations tailored to their specific use cases.

  * Middleware Integration: There is also the option of implement middleware solutions or an integration platform that supports bidirectional communication between medical devices and the Gateway, while also facilitating HL7 message transformation and routing. This approach could provide more flexibility in handling different data formats and protocols from various medical devices.

  * Cloud-Based Data Processing: We could also consider leveraging cloud-based platforms for data processing and integration, where medical device data can be transmitted to the cloud using HL7 standards and then processed, analyzed, and forwarded to the Gateway as needed. This approach offers scalability, real-time analytics capabilities, and remote access to data, but obviously comes with a literal price.
