# Adopting a Messaging Broker for DeviceGateway

## Context
In the context of DeviceGateway, a physical device with embedded software designed to facilitate communication between various components in our ecosystem, we require a messaging broker to efficiently route and manage messages exchanged between components, supporting both wired and wireless (WLAN) communication channels. 
A messaging broker serves as an intermediary to facilitate communication between devices and consumers.

## Decision: 
The decision is to implement a message broker physical component, which would facilitate data transmission between various types of devices and consumers, over wired and wireless communication.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences

  * Efficient Message Routing: The messaging broker's support for multiple messaging protocols and message persistence will allow DeviceGateway to efficiently route and manage messages, ensuring reliable and timely delivery between components.
  * Flexibility: The messaging broker's support for various messaging patterns, such as publish-subscribe and point-to-point, will provide flexibility in designing communication flows between components.
  * Scalability: The messaging broker's ability to handle large volumes of messages and maintain high availability will support scalability as our ecosystem grows.
  * Security: The messaging broker will provide robust security features, such as access control lists (ACLs), SSL/TLS encryption, and user authentication, ensuring secure communication between components.
  * Monitoring and Management: The messaging broker will offer extensive monitoring and management capabilities, allowing us to track message delivery, monitor queues, and troubleshoot issues, ensuring the overall health and performance of our communication infrastructure.
   
## Options
  * Open-Source Message Broker: A great option would be to consider leveraging an open-source message broker software, such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ, to fulfill the messaging component's functionality. Open-source solutions offer flexibility, community support, and customization options without vendor lock-in.
  * Edge Computing Integration: Investigate integrating edge computing capabilities with the message broker component to perform initial data processing and filtering at the network edge. This reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network and improves response times for critical messages.
