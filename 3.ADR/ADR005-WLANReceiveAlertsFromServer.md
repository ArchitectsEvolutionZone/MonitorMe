# Mobile App use for Nurses to Receive Alerts and Notifications from On-Premise Server "MonitorMe" via WLAN

## Context
Nurses play a critical role in patient care, often requiring real-time access to patient data and alerts. 
The decision to implement a mobile app that allows nurses to receive alerts from the on-premise server "MonitorMe" is driven by the need to
improve response times and provide greater flexibility in patient monitoring.

## Status
Proposed

## Decision
The decision to use a mobile app for nurses to receive alerts from the on-premise server "MonitorMe" via WLAN is made to achieve the following benefits:
   * Real-Time Alerts: The mobile app provides nurses with immediate access to patient alerts, ensuring timely response to critical events.
   * Enhanced Communication: The mobile app facilitates seamless communication between the on-premise server "MonitorMe" and nurses, improving coordination and efficiency.
   * Improved Response Times: Nurses can quickly receive and respond to alerts, leading to faster interventions and improved patient outcomes.
   * Greater Flexibility: Nurses can access alerts from anywhere within the hospital premises, enhancing flexibility and mobility.

## Consequences

Pros:
   * Enhanced Patient Safety: Real-time alerts enable nurses to quickly respond to critical patient events, improving overall patient safety.
   * Streamlined Workflow: The mobile app streamlines communication and alerts, reducing the time needed to access and respond to critical information.
   * Increased Efficiency: Real-time alerts and communication can lead to more efficient patient monitoring and care delivery.
   * Improved Nurse Satisfaction: Providing nurses with tools that facilitate their work and improve efficiency can lead to increased job satisfaction.
  
Cons:
   * Security Considerations: The mobile app must comply with strict security standards to protect patient data and maintain privacy.
   * Network Reliability: WLAN networks can be susceptible to interference and signal degradation, impacting the reliability of alert delivery.
   * Training and Adoption: Nurses may require training to effectively use the mobile app and its features, and some may be resistant to adopting new technology.

## Options
  * Push Notifications: Implement push notification functionality within the mobile app to deliver alerts directly to nurses' devices, even when the app is not actively in use. This ensures timely alert delivery and reduces reliance on continuous WLAN connectivity.
  * Offline Mode: Develop an offline mode feature within the mobile app that allows nurses to access previously received alerts and patient data, even in areas with limited or no WLAN coverage. This ensures continuous access to critical information regardless of network availability.
  * Integration with Nurse Call Systems: Explore integration capabilities with existing nurse call systems to synchronize alerts between the mobile app and nurse call stations. This ensures consistent alert delivery across different communication channels and enhances nurse responsiveness.
  * Geofencing Alerts: Implement geofencing functionality within the mobile app to trigger alerts based on nurses' physical location within the hospital premises. This allows for targeted alert delivery to nurses in specific areas, optimizing response times and workflow efficiency.
  * Remote Monitoring Capabilities: Extend the mobile app functionality to enable remote monitoring of patient alerts and data, allowing nurses to access critical information even when off-site. This enhances flexibility and supports telemedicine initiatives, but requires robust security measures to protect patient data during remote access.
