# Using In-Memory Caching for Storing Snapshots and Frequently Accessed Data

## Context
In our software ecosystem, we have various components that frequently access and update snapshots of data and other frequently accessed information. 
These snapshots and frequently accessed data are used for analytics, reporting, and various other purposes. 
Storing this data in a way that allows for fast access and updates is crucial to the performance of our system.

## Decision: 
We have decided to implement an in-memory caching system to store these snapshots and frequently accessed data. 
This decision is based on the following considerations:
  * Performance: In-memory caching allows for extremely fast read and write access, significantly improving the performance of our system.
  * Reduced Load on Main Datastore: By caching frequently accessed data in-memory, we can reduce the load on our main datastores, which can be particularly important for scaling our system.
  * Scalability: In-memory caching systems can easily scale horizontally by adding more caching nodes, making it an excellent choice for our growing system.
  * Snapshots: Storing snapshots in-memory allows for quick access to historical data, which is essential for many of our use cases.
  * Cost-Effectiveness: In-memory caching systems are generally more cost-effective than traditional storage solutions for frequently accessed data.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences
 * Data Consistency: In-memory caching systems generally prioritize performance over data consistency, so we must carefully consider how this affects our data and implement strategies to ensure consistency when necessary.
 * Memory Management: We will need to carefully manage memory usage, as an in-memory caching system can consume significant amounts of memory depending on the size of the cached data.
 * Backup and Recovery: We will need to implement backup and recovery strategies for the cached data to prevent data loss in the event of a failure.
 * Monitoring: We will need to implement monitoring to ensure the health and performance of our in-memory caching system.
 * Cache Invalidation: We will need to implement strategies for cache invalidation to ensure that stale data is not returned to users.

## Options
 * Disk-based Caching: Instead of using an in-memory caching system, we could implement a disk-based caching solution. This involves storing frequently accessed data on disk rather than in memory. While disk-based caching may not offer the same level of performance as in-memory caching, it can still provide significant performance improvements compared to accessing data from the main data store.
 * Database Materialized Views: Materialized views are precomputed tables that store the results of a query. We could use database materialized views to store snapshots of frequently accessed data. This allows us to efficiently retrieve and query the snapshot data without the need for additional caching layers.
 * Data Warehousing: Data warehousing involves storing large volumes of data in a centralized repository optimized for analytical queries. We could use a data warehousing solution to store snapshots of frequently accessed data, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of historical data.
 * Distributed Cache: Instead of using a single in-memory caching system, we could implement a distributed cache solution. Distributed caches replicate data across multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and scalability. This allows us to store and access snapshots of frequently accessed data across a distributed network of cache nodes.
