# Implementing an On-Premise Server Cluster for Redundancy

## Context
We have an on-premise server that is critical to our software ecosystem. 
This server hosts various services and databases that are used by our applications. 
To ensure high availability and resilience against hardware failures, we are considering implementing a cluster of physical machines to host these services. 
This cluster would provide redundancy and allow for automatic failover in case of physical issues with one of the machines.

## Decision: 
We have decided to implement an on-premise server cluster, consisting of multiple physical machines, to host our critical services. 
This decision is based on the following considerations:
 * High Availability: A cluster of physical machines provides redundancy, ensuring that our services remain available even if one of the machines fails.
 * Automatic Failover: With the proper setup and configuration, the cluster can automatically detect and respond to failures, allowing for seamless failover to healthy machines.
 * Load Balancing: The cluster can be configured to distribute incoming requests across multiple machines, improving performance and scalability.
 * Resilience: A cluster of physical machines provides resilience against hardware failures, ensuring that our services remain available even in the event of a hardware issue.
 
## Status
Proposed

## Consequences
 * Cost: Implementing and maintaining a cluster of physical machines can be more expensive than a single server. We will need to carefully consider the cost implications and ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.
 * Complexity: A cluster of physical machines introduces additional complexity in terms of setup, configuration, and maintenance. We will need to ensure that we have the necessary expertise and resources to manage the cluster effectively.
 * Scalability: A cluster of physical machines can provide scalability in terms of increasing capacity by adding more machines to the cluster. However, we will need to carefully consider how we scale our services and ensure that the cluster can handle increased load.
 * Monitoring and Management: We will need to implement monitoring and management tools to ensure the health and performance of the cluster. This includes monitoring for hardware failures, load balancing, and automatic failover.
 * Backup and Recovery: We will need to implement backup and recovery strategies for the data stored on the cluster to prevent data loss in the event of a failure.
   
## Options
 * Cloud-Based Hosting: Instead of implementing an on-premise server cluster, we could explore hosting our critical services on a cloud-based platform.
 * Virtualization: We could consider virtualizing our server infrastructure instead of deploying a physical server cluster. Virtualization allows us to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical server, providing flexibility, scalability, and resource isolation. This approach can reduce hardware costs and simplify management compared to a physical server cluster.
 * Managed Services: We could opt for managed hosting services offered by third-party providers.
 * Containerization: Another option is to containerize our applications using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
